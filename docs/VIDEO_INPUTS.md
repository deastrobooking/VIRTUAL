# Cameras and video capture cards

VIRTUAL routes macOS video inputs to any of its four decks. This includes
cameras and capture cards whose drivers expose them through AVFoundation.
The input can use deck effects, blending, freeze and camera-to-clip recording.
Video inputs are live and cannot seek. Embedded capture-card audio is not
decoded by this path; select an audio-analysis input separately.

1. Connect the capture card and its HDMI/SDI source. Install the manufacturer's
   macOS driver if required, and select the connector in its control utility.
2. Select a deck and open **Video input · camera / capture card**.
3. Click **Refresh**, then select the input by name.
4. Select a supported capture resolution and rate. 23.976, 29.97 and 59.94 use
   exact rational rates, not integer rounding. Match the source and card mode.
5. Start with **Automatic** pixel format, or choose NV12, UYVY 4:2:2,
   YUYV 4:2:2 or BGRA as appropriate for the device.
6. Click **Connect to Deck**. Check the live status and preview before enabling
   program output. Save the project to retain the deck's device and format.

For dark crowd footage, open the deck's **GPU effects** and choose the
**Crowd Night Vision** package in its algorithmic package slot. Start with
**Silhouette Edge** for bright contours on black, **Neon Crowd** for cyan
outlines, **Night Vision** for lifted green/amber detail, or
**High-Contrast Mono** for thresholded silhouettes. Adjust **Shadow lift** and
**Black point** first, then tune **Edge / luma threshold** and **Threshold
softness**. **Source detail** mixes the camera image back under the treatment;
**Edge width** changes the contour sampling scale. Grain and phosphor animation
are optional and can be driven through the usual effect modulation or MIDI
mapping. These looks enhance detail present in the captured signal; they cannot
recover detail the sensor did not record.

Camera-to-clip recording stores the incoming source frames before deck effects,
so you can change the look later. Use program recording when you need a file
with the full mixed and processed output; that is a separate planned feature.

**Manual input / custom size** accepts an AVFoundation name or index and custom
dimensions. A native device identity is stored for discovered inputs and
resolved at connection time. Names that could match multiple devices are
rejected; identical cards may require manual indices. Manual indices can change
after USB devices are reordered, so recheck them before a show.

Discovery uses native AVFoundation rather than FFmpeg's generic device-list
API. Opening and decoding use FFmpeg's
[AVFoundation input backend](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-devices.html#avfoundation).
Enumerating devices does not start video capture:

```sh
cargo run -p virtual-media --example list_video_inputs
```

If the card is missing, check power, cabling, driver installation and whether
macOS exposes it as a camera/video input. Grant camera permission to the app or
Terminal when running from Cargo. A card available only through a proprietary
SDK needs a separate adapter; a model-specific adapter is not included here.
Unsupported resolution/rate or missing signal is reported as an input error.
Reconnect using a supported mode; VIRTUAL does not automatically change the
card's HDMI/SDI connector or deinterlace an incoming signal.

Physical capture-card validation remains necessary: verify signal loss,
unplug/replug, fractional-rate pacing, source replacement, application exit and
saved-project restoration on the actual device. Existing synthetic capture
tests cannot establish hardware compatibility.
