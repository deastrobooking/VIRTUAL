# Effect package authoring (`master-v1` and `deck-v1`)

This document describes both executable shader contracts. `master-v1` runs in
either master slot with one or two passes and optional fixed history.
`deck-v1` runs as one stateless pass after one deck's built-ins and before its
layer blend. Manifest v1 implies master placement; manifest v2 states targets
and ABI explicitly.

VIRTUAL discovers these packages from immediate child directories under every
resolved effect resource root. Each package directory contains `effect.json`
and a WGSL file referenced by that manifest.

The shipped root is resolved independently of the process launch directory:
the source workspace is used during development, `Contents/Resources/effects`
inside a macOS app bundle, or an `effects` directory beside a release binary.
An existing `effects` directory in the active show workspace is scanned too.
`VIRTUAL_EFFECT_PATH` adds one or more platform-separated roots for a custom
rig. User packages live in
`~/Library/Application Support/VIRTUAL/effects` on macOS, or under
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/virtual/effects` (falling back to
`~/.local/share/virtual/effects`) on other platforms.

Roots are evaluated in this order:

1. Trusted bundled/development resources
2. The active show workspace
3. `VIRTUAL_EFFECT_PATH` entries in platform path-list order
4. The per-user effect directory

The first valid package ID wins. A lower-priority duplicate is excluded and
reported in registry diagnostics; it never silently replaces a bundled
package. Invalid edits to a previously loaded manifest retain that manifest's
last-known-good descriptor and GPU pipeline until the exact file becomes valid
again, changes identity, or is removed.

## Added performance looks (September 2026)

| Package | Placement | Passes | Controls and looks |
|---|---|---|---|
| Analog CRT | Deck or master | 1 | Curvature, scanlines, RGB mask, bleed, jitter, grain; Broadcast, Arcade, Worn tape |
| Thermal Contours | Deck or master | 1 | Iron/Aurora/Monochrome palettes, heat contrast, contours, edge detail; Iron heat, Aurora map, Topography |
| Gravitational Lens | Deck or master | 1 | Mass, radius, vortex, falloff, movable center, pulse; Singularity, Liquid orbit, Repulsor |
| Anamorphic Flare | Master | 2 | Soft highlight extraction, horizontal streaks, tint and dispersion; Cinema blue, Golden hour, Laser streaks |
| Kaleidoscope | Deck or master | 1 | 2–24 radial segments, rotation, zoom, source angle, center, spin, spiral twist; Sixfold, Stained glass, Spiral bloom |
| Mirror Symmetry | Deck or master | 1 | Left/right, top/bottom or four-way reflection, rotated axis, source side, center, zoom, spin; Bilateral, Four-way, Diagonal |
| Mirror Mosaic | Deck or master | 1 | 1–12 columns/rows, rotated grid, source zoom/center, horizontal/vertical drift; Hall of mirrors, Diamond glass, Moving grid |

Choose a package in the selected deck's package slot or either master slot,
then choose a named look. The generated parameter controls support the existing
MIDI/modulation workflow. Anamorphic Flare appears only in the master list;
its intermediate highlight pass is not supported by the one-pass deck runtime.

New effects apply slot wet mixing only to the final result and do not require
history. CRT and Lens can move transparent coverage; Thermal and Flare preserve
the input alpha. Flare samples 5 times in extraction and 51 times in its fixed
gather, so measure its cost on the intended show machine. All kernels have fixed
work bounds. Coordinates in the existing polynomial recursion packages are now
bounded before the next iteration to prevent overflow at extreme settings.

Kaleidoscope, Mirror Symmetry and Mirror Mosaic reflect coordinates at image
boundaries, avoiding stretched borders when zoomed out or rotated. They transform
RGBA together, preserving source transparency. Radial geometry and rotation are
aspect-correct. Segment, row and column sliders round to whole numbers. Rotation,
source angle and twist use radians; spin uses radians per second and mosaic drift
uses tiles per second. Zero spin/drift holds a static look. Positive source side
samples the right/bottom half at zero axis rotation; Negative samples left/top.
Kaleidoscope and Mirror Symmetry move the reflection center with Center X/Y;
Mirror Mosaic's Source center moves the sampled region within every tile.
Each uses two texture samples per pixel, including the dry sample, with no loops
or history buffers.

A reproducible GPU preview tool renders a synthetic chart through a bundled
master package (use `none` for the original):

```sh
cargo run -p virtual-render --example effect_preview -- analog-crt > preview.ppm
# Optional second argument selects a named preset:
cargo run -p virtual-render --example effect_preview -- kaleidoscope spiral-bloom > spiral.ppm
```

## Repeater, transitions, noise and cellular pixels

Five additional packages expose MIDI-learnable controls through the existing
master/deck effect panels. Each includes three named looks.

| Package | Placement | Controls |
|---|---|---|
| Video Repeater | Master only | Trail amount, persistence, random movement, wander speed, X/Y drift, rotation, zoom, 1–8 repeats, stepped movement, Add/Screen/Maximum blend, seed |
| Transition Lab | Deck or master | Progress, Noise dissolve / Radial collapse / Tile shatter / Scan wipe / Vortex fade, distortion, tile scale, softness, twist, seed |
| Jitter & Noise | Deck or master | Scanline tear / Block shuffle / Analog wobble / Radial shake / RGB jitter; Film grain / Block static / Scanline hiss, amount, scale, rate, seed |
| Life Mosaic | Deck or master | Cell density, luminance threshold, mutation, gap, mutation rate, 1–2 local generations, Life B3/S23 or HighLife B36/S23 |
| Cyclic Cells | Deck or master | Cell density, seed threshold, mutation, gap, mutation rate, 1–2 local generations, color-state count, neighbor threshold, palette shift |

**Repeater:** choose Video Repeater in a master package slot. Raise Trail amount
and Persistence, then use Random movement and X/Y drift to place echoes behind
new video. Arcade ghosts, Random scatter and Spiral tunnel are starting looks.
It feeds back the previous output of that slot and clears with the existing
history lifecycle. Repeat count performs at most eight history samples per
pixel. Echo persistence is per rendered frame; Wander speed is changes per
second. It is not a multi-frame delay bank. Zero Wander speed holds the random
movement field; zero movement/drift/rotation/zoom holds the echoes in place.

**Transitions:** at full wet, Progress 0 preserves the signal and Progress 1
removes it. Fade to 1, change the scene, then bring Progress back to 0. The
package does not read the second crossfader bus and is not an A/B wipe. Lower
wet values blend with the unaffected signal, so they do not fully black out.

**Cellular pixels:** both effects seed a 5×5 neighborhood from current video,
then compute up to two local automaton generations. They are video-driven
stylizations, not persistent simulations. Life Mosaic uses binary birth and
survival; Cyclic Cells advances a cell when enough neighbors have the next
color state. Zero Mutation rate freezes random reseeding, while changing video
continues to drive the cells. They use 25 seed texture samples plus dry and
cell-color samples per pixel; measure them at the intended output resolution.

All five preserve a zero-wet dry path. Stateless packages support transparent
deck sources; repeater history transforms RGBA together and clips offscreen
samples instead of stretching border pixels.

## Manifest

`format` must be `virtual-effect`. Packages using an older format name still
load; see [Development](DEVELOPMENT.md#on-disk-formats-and-compatibility).

```json
{
  "format": "virtual-effect",
  "version": 1,
  "id": "spectral-echo",
  "name": "Spectral echo",
  "role": "master_effect",
  "shader": "spectral_echo.wgsl",
  "vertex_entry": "vs_main",
  "fragment_entry": "fs_combine",
  "passes": [
    {
      "fragment_entry": "fs_extract"
    },
    {
      "fragment_entry": "fs_combine"
    }
  ],
  "parameters": [
    {
      "id": "spread",
      "label": "Spread",
      "minimum": 0.0,
      "maximum": 0.08,
      "default": 0.018
    }
  ]
}
```

IDs contain lowercase ASCII letters, digits and hyphens. Shader paths are
package-relative `.wgsl` paths without traversal. A package declares 1–32
unique finite parameter ranges. Parameter IDs are persisted in projects, while
the shader receives values in manifest declaration order.

### Extended controls and looks

Parameters remain sliders by default. Packages can opt into a richer generated
interface without adding app-specific code:

```json
{
  "id": "function",
  "label": "Function",
  "group": "Recursive function",
  "minimum": 0.0,
  "maximum": 2.0,
  "default": 0.0,
  "control": "choice",
  "options": [
    {"label": "Mirror IFS", "value": 0.0},
    {"label": "Julia warp", "value": 1.0},
    {"label": "Möbius petals", "value": 2.0}
  ]
}
```

`control` supports `slider`, `toggle`, and `choice`. Contiguous parameters with
the same non-empty `group` receive a shared GUI heading. A package-level
`description` appears above the controls.

Package-level `presets` provide one-click looks. Each preset has a stable ID,
label, optional description, and a partial `values` object keyed by parameter
ID. Unlisted controls retain their current value, which makes a preset useful
as either a complete look or a focused transform. The GUI also provides a
reset button that restores every manifest default.

`master_effect` registers a selectable custom master-slot effect. `passes` may
contain one or two fragment entry points. When omitted, the legacy
`fragment_entry` declares a one-pass effect.
`master_processor` is reserved for replacing the built-in blur/feedback
processor pipeline.

## `master-v1` bindings

Custom shaders must use group 0 with these bindings:

| Binding | WGSL resource |
|---|---|
| 0 | Filtering sampler |
| 1 | Original slot-input `texture_2d<f32>` |
| 2 | Intermediate effect `texture_2d<f32>` |
| 3 | `MasterEffectGlobals` uniform |
| 4 | Previous final-frame history `texture_2d<f32>` |
| 5 | Previous output for this custom slot `texture_2d<f32>` |

The uniform layout is:

```wgsl
struct MasterEffectGlobals {
    direction: vec2<f32>,
    texel_size: vec2<f32>,
    radius: f32,
    mix_amount: f32,
    mode: u32,
    feedback: f32,
    time_seconds: f32,
    parameter_count: u32,
    pass_index: u32,
    pass_count: u32,
    parameters: array<vec4<f32>, 8>,
    history_valid: u32,
}
```

Scalar parameter `i` is read from
`globals.parameters[i / 4][i % 4]`. `mix_amount` is the slot wet control.
`time_seconds` is monotonic performance time. A custom shader normally samples
`original_texture`, computes its effect and applies the common wet mix.
`history_valid` is appended after the original master-v1 parameter array, so
older shaders that omit binding 5 and this final field retain the same uniform
offsets and remain compatible.

## Bounded passes

A one-pass package reads `original_texture` and writes the slot output.

For a two-pass package:

1. Pass 0 reads the slot input from `original_texture` and writes the shared
   scratch texture.
2. Pass 1 reads the unchanged slot input from `original_texture`, reads pass
   zero through `effect_texture`, and writes the slot output.

Apply `mix_amount` in the final pass so the intermediate remains fully
available. `pass_index` is zero-based and `pass_count` is one or two. Every
declared entry point is compiled as one candidate set; any failure retains the
entire previous set. The cap is structural: both master slots reuse existing
scratch and ping targets, and no package texture is allocated during a frame.

## Modulation and MIDI

Every declared parameter automatically appears as a target in the master
modulation matrix and receives MIDI Learn/Clear buttons. VIRTUAL derives target
identity from the package ID and parameter ID, so parameter declaration order
may change without redirecting saved routes or mappings.

Master modulation sources are three free-running or tempo-synchronized LFOs,
RMS, bass, mid, high, transient, beat phase and four-beat bar phase. Route
amount is bipolar and spans half of the declared parameter range at magnitude
1. Final values are clamped to the manifest minimum and maximum.

## Lifecycle and safety

Choose **Refresh registry** after adding a package. Registry discovery and
schema/WGSL validation run on a bounded, generation-tagged worker. A newer
request replaces a pending request, stale results are discarded and the prior
catalog stays visible during the scan. Once a package is registered, its
manifest and WGSL are fingerprinted every 500 ms.
Naga validates syntax and entry points, and wgpu validates the fixed
bind-group/pipeline contract on the worker. A successful candidate replaces
that package pipeline between frames.

Invalid edits never replace the last working pipeline. A package that is
missing or has never compiled uses the built-in neutral copy pass, so loading
an unavailable project effect cannot blank program output.

Custom packages currently receive one or two passes in either master slot.
They may request one fixed history resource:

```json
"resources": {
  "history": "previous_slot_output"
}
```

When declared, binding 5 contains the physical slot's previous successful
output. `history_valid` is zero on the first frame and after source, project,
resize, blackout, disable/bypass, missing-package or identity resets. A shader
must return a clean current-frame result while validity is zero. After the slot
renders, VIRTUAL copies its output into history for the next frame. Freeze
retains history without evolving it.

One full-resolution RGBA8-sRGB history texture is reserved for each master
slot, so package selection cannot change memory use during a performance.
Packages cannot request arbitrary auxiliary texture counts, formats or sizes.

## Per-deck and package-graph roadmap

Per-deck packages are executable. The renderer materializes only affected deck
branches after built-in processing and before layer blending. The no-package
path remains fused, and missing, bypassed or zero-wet packages pass through.

Manifest v2 target metadata distinguishes master and deck placement. The
operator-facing deck runtime uses a dedicated `deck-v1` ABI, one stateless
fragment slot per deck and neutral fallback for an unsupported or missing
package.

The catalog-level v2 shape is:

```json
{
  "format": "virtual-effect",
  "version": 2,
  "id": "deck-effect",
  "name": "Deck effect",
  "role": "effect",
  "targets": ["deck"],
  "abi": "deck-v1",
  "shader": "effect.wgsl",
  "parameters": [
    {
      "id": "amount",
      "label": "Amount",
      "minimum": 0.0,
      "maximum": 1.0,
      "default": 0.5
    }
  ]
}
```

Version 2 requires one or two unique targets. `master-v1` targets master only.
`deck-v1` must include deck, remains stateless and one-pass, and may also list
master for dual placement. Deck candidates receive schema, Naga, bind-group and
real-GPU pipeline validation on the deck reload worker. A selected package's
ID, bypass, wet value, named parameters and eight stable-key modulation routes
persist per deck in project schema v6. The routes use the existing three deck
LFOs plus RMS, bass, mid, high, transient, beat-phase and bar-phase sources.
Generated parameter controls expose MIDI learn, and OSC addresses use the same
stable package/parameter key.

`deck-v1` uses the same group-0 bindings as `master-v1`; bindings 1, 2, 4 and
5 all reference the materialized deck input because history and intermediate
passes are unsupported. Its append-only uniform tail follows `history_valid`:

```wgsl
    deck_index: u32,
    source_extent: vec2<u32>,
    composition_extent: vec2<u32>,
```

The complete uniform allocation is 208 bytes. These fields begin at offsets
180, 184 and 192 bytes respectively. Older dual-placement shaders may declare
only the original `master-v1` prefix.

Shared WGSL imports arrive later through a versioned, allow-listed module
namespace. When that happens, fingerprints and hot reload must include every
transitive imported module. Raising the current two-pass cap is not the graph
design; a future typed package graph will declare pass inputs, output formats,
resolution, resource lifetimes and hard budgets explicitly.

See [Shader system](SHADER_SYSTEM.md) for the ordered delivery plan and
acceptance gates.

## Editor support

The repository recommends the optional
[`wgsl-analyzer`](https://github.com/wgsl-analyzer/wgsl-analyzer) VS Code
extension for WGSL completion, navigation and diagnostics. Naga validation in
VIRTUAL remains authoritative for package loading, and the real-GPU tests
remain authoritative for the `wgpu` binding/pipeline contract.
