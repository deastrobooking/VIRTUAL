# Application review

Review date: 2026-10-10

Open rehearsal and certification items from the event and finalization
reviews are tracked under [Phase 7 in the roadmap](ROADMAP.md#phase-7-release-hardening).

October follow-up: project writes now run on a bounded background worker;
active camera reads support cancellation/deadlines; camera recordings retain
capture timing across dropped frames; and project schema v10 stores 32 distinct
scenes with per-deck clip, stop and no-change actions. Older projects receive
legacy scene assignments. Physical camera/display/storage failure
certification and macOS packaging remain open. See the reliability entry in
[release notes](RELEASE_NOTES.md) for behavior and limits.

## Executive assessment

VIRTUAL is a functional four-deck VJ instrument with a credible media and
rendering foundation. Direct HAP upload, bounded FFmpeg fallback, independent
A/B composition, deck and master effects, audio/MIDI/OSC control, clean program
output and deterministic session recovery are implemented and covered by more
than 200 automated tests.

The main release risk is no longer missing mixer fundamentals. It is show-machine
certification, application packaging and measured expansion of the shader path.
Per-deck package execution, selection and persistence are now implemented for
one stateless pass per deck. Stable deck-package modulation, MIDI and OSC
identities, alpha/culling diagnostics and non-blocking per-deck GPU pass timing
are implemented; show-machine certification remains. External stage
work still centers on multi-projector routing and hardware validation. Link
tempo sync and optional NDI output are already implemented.

## Current strengths

### Media and rendering

- HAP remains block-compressed through GPU upload; conventional media and stills
  use isolated FFmpeg fallback paths.
- Exact media timestamps, bounded workers, reusable frame leases and generation
  checks prevent unbounded backlog and obsolete-frame presentation.
- Four decks feed independent linear-light A/B composites with 35 blend modes,
  transforms, crop, Solo/Bypass and fused built-in deck-effect groups. Geometry
  remains the UV prepass; Color and Stylize can change relative order.
- The program render is shared by an operator preview and clean second window.
  Display targeting, fullscreen, calibration overlays and surface recovery are
  observable rather than implicit.
- Two bounded master slots support built-in and validated one/two-pass WGSL
  packages with generation-safe last-known-good reload and one optional custom
  history texture per physical master slot.

### Performance workflow

- The 4 × 8 clip grid supports 32 independently assigned scenes in four banks,
  quantization, folder import,
  missing-media relink, safe slot movement and explicit clip deletion.
- The selected deck has one primary, always-visible editor. Deck row labels and
  clip slots retarget it directly; secondary deck editors no longer bury the
  active controls.
- Show Mode locks setup and destructive/structural edits while retaining clip,
  scene, transport, mixer, Solo/Bypass, live deck-FX controls and compact
  master-effect identity/bypass/wet cards.
- MIDI supports multiple persisted controllers, learn/clear, relative modes,
  soft takeover and reconnect. OSC input/output shares the command gateway and
  supports bounded timetag scheduling.
- Audio RMS, bands and transient analysis plus beat/bar phase feed the deck and
  master modulation systems.

### Persistence and validation

- Project schema v10 migrates supported older projects, validates scene and
  graph values, and persists take identity and deterministic seeds.
- Structural edits and performance controls enter an origin-aware command log.
  Bounded JSONL journals, checkpoints, recovery branches, markers and exported
  take copies are implemented.
- The workspace passes full tests and strict Clippy. One extended decoder reopen
  soak remains intentionally opt-in for release candidates.

## Stage-critical gaps

### 1. Hardware certification

The clean output, audio capture and multi-controller MIDI paths need a recorded
show-machine matrix: sustained 1080p/UHD playback, display disconnect/reconnect,
sleep/wake, audio permission and device loss, MIDI reconnect and storage failure.
Use [RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md](RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md) for every candidate.

### 2. Packaging and distribution

The repository now produces a locally ad-hoc-signed macOS application bundle
with privacy usage strings and bundled effects. *Updated 2026-10-05:*
`build-macos.sh --portable` now bundles FFmpeg and its dependencies. Native
Windows and Linux archives are also built in CI. Developer ID signing,
notarization, distribution notices and a pre-macOS-26 FFmpeg build remain open
before public release.

### 3. Diagnostics depth

FPS, surface health, decoder drop/repeat/late totals and RGBA lease counters are
visible. Deck-package GPU pass timings are implemented. Upload timing, frame-time
history, queue occupancy and per-deck decode latency are still needed to explain a marginal show machine without attaching a profiler.

### 4. Shader-path budgeting

Algorithmic WGSL packages execute in the two master slots and one stateless
slot per deck. The deck path selectively materializes active layers and has a
fixed 1080p/UHD memory ceiling; transparent-alpha coverage, visible
invisible-branch counters and per-deck pass-time telemetry are implemented.
Target-machine measurement remains a release gate. HDR, arbitrary pass graphs
and compute remain later work.
See [Shader system](SHADER_SYSTEM.md) for the accepted sequence and invariants.

### 5. Stage workflow gaps

Projection calibration currently targets one output with a single quad, crop,
rectangular masks and edge feathering. Multiple projector outputs, mesh/polygon
warps and 3D projector simulation remain future work. Video and automation
reverse playback also remain unimplemented; see [feature designs](FEATURE_DESIGNS.md).

## Engineering risks

### Concentrated application orchestration

`virtual-app/src/main.rs` remains roughly 1,450 lines and still coordinates
windowing, media, projects, cameras, tempo and rendering. Action dispatch,
output lifecycle and the toolbar/setup/diagnostics surfaces have been extracted;
`ui.rs` is now roughly 990 lines with focused `clips`, `deck`, `master_fx`,
`midi`, `midi_manager` and `theme` modules.

Next seams:

- `media_session.rs`: per-deck decoder, scheduler and transport orchestration
- Remaining top-level render-loop coordination after media-session ownership

These are behavior-preserving refactors and should land in small validated
checkpoints.

### Project migration discipline

Schema evolution reached v5 before golden project files were established. The
repository checks in v1-v6 fixtures and tests a v9-to-v10 migration for scenes.
Extend the golden chain as part of release hardening and keep migration and
current-schema save/reload coverage mandatory for every schema revision.

### External integration and licensing

- GPL-2.0-or-later is selected and Link tempo/phase integration is implemented;
  network/hardware certification remains. See [Link](ABLETON_LINK.md).
- NDI requires its SDK and redistribution terms. Keep any integration in an
  optional crate/feature with a build that remains functional without the SDK.
- Syphon/Spout requires platform-specific native texture interop and should not
  be estimated as a thin Rust dependency addition.
- `wgpu` and `naga` must move together with the `egui-wgpu` compatibility line;
  do not introduce two incompatible `wgpu` versions.

## Recommended order

```text
physical show-machine certification and release packaging
    -> frame-time/decode/upload diagnostics on target hardware
    -> bounded video reverse playback and recording workflow
    -> multi-output projection routing and mesh mapping
    -> remaining behavior-preserving media-session seam
```

This ordering protects the working show path while turning the next external
integrations into optional, testable additions.
