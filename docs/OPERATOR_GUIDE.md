# VIRTUAL operator guide

## Session journal

Every app run records its supported performance commands under
`.virtual/session/` in the current workspace. The operator header reports
journaled command and checkpoint counts, queue overruns and persistence errors.

Journal writing is bounded and asynchronous. If storage stalls or fails,
program output continues and the in-memory performance take remains active.
The runtime creates an atomically replaced recovery checkpoint every 600
rendered frames.

Open **Session recovery**, select **Scan journals**, choose a prior take and
select **Restore take**. The active journal is never offered as a recovery
candidate. The panel reports checkpoints and safely ignored torn tails. Load
the matching `.virtual` project first so recovered clip launches resolve to the
same media slots. Restore applies mixer, transport, output, effect, LFO and
modulation state, then continues recording in a fresh journal.

Version-six projects carry a stable project identity and a bounded catalog of
take names, IDs, journal filenames and creation times. The recovery scan hides
journals linked to another project and labels older journals as unlinked.
Enter a printable name before **Start named take** or **Restore as named
branch**. Scoped deterministic seeds can be edited in the same panel. Seeds
and the active typed graph are saved with the project.

Use the timeline slider to select an earlier show time, then choose **Restore
cursor as branch**. Replay starts from the closest preceding checkpoint.
Enter a label and choose **Add marker** while recording; after scanning that
journal, marker buttons position the replay cursor at their exact show times.
Project take metadata can be renamed or removed; removal only unlinks the
catalog entry and deliberately leaves the journal file on disk.

Choose **Export copy** to copy the selected take into the displayed export
directory (relative paths resolve from the workspace), or **Archive copy** to
copy it under `.virtual/archive`. Each operation creates a new unique folder
with the journal and its checkpoint when present. Existing exports and source
session files are never overwritten, moved or removed.

MIDI mappings, performance keyboard shortcuts and continuous mixer/effect/LFO
controls use the same command gateway. Their origin is retained in the journal,
so a replay can distinguish an operator gesture from a specific MIDI device or
keyboard emergency command.

Open **OSC input**, enter a UDP bind address and choose **Listen** to accept
remote mixer, deck, clip, scene, tempo and output commands. Use loopback
(`127.0.0.1:9000`) unless the show-control network should reach the app. OSC
sender addresses are retained as journal origins, and malformed/overflow
counters are visible beside the listener status. The complete route table is
in [OSC.md](OSC.md).

Set **Feedback target** and choose **Send feedback** to transmit an immediate
state snapshot followed by accepted control changes. Future OSC bundle
timetags execute on the first frame at or after their NTP deadline; pending
and rejected scheduled-message counts are visible in the same panel.

Deck transforms, crop/source/blend choices, effect-slot order, LFO and
modulation routing, master effects/modulation, and accepted media assignments
are also journaled as stable field commands. Project opening establishes a new
baseline and is not recorded as live performance traffic.

VIRTUAL is a four-deck live video mixer. Each deck can play a clip or receive a
live camera/capture-card feed, run its own effects and modulation, and feed the
A/B crossfader.

## Start the application

```sh
cargo run -p virtual-app
cargo run -p virtual-app -- clip-a.mov clip-b.mp4
cargo run -p virtual-app -- performance.virtual
```

For performance testing, use a release build:

```sh
cargo run --release -p virtual-app
```

## Preflight and Show Mode

The rail beneath the application header summarizes output health, missing or
still-loading media, requested MIDI devices that have not connected, a
requested audio input that is disconnected, rejected master or deck effect
reloads and effect-registry errors, unsaved project changes, and saves that
are still pending or have failed. **PREFLIGHT READY** means every one of these
is clear; audio, MIDI and OSC remain optional unless the project actually uses
them. Hover **effect attention** to see which effect check failed.

The toolbar, emergency controls and preflight rail sit outside the scrolling
editor, so they stay on screen however far the editor is scrolled. Save
progress and save failures appear there in both modes. A failure stays visible
until the same file saves successfully or you press **Dismiss save error**.

After setup and saving, press **SHOW MODE** in the top bar. Show Mode keeps
clip and scene launches, deck transport, levels, solo/bypass, live per-deck
effect sliders, compact master-effect bypass/wet cards, the A/B crossfader,
master opacity, freeze and emergency blackout available. Custom cards keep the
selected algorithmic package name visible. It hides or locks
output/project/device setup, file drops, slot movement, relink/clear, eject,
MIDI mapping, audio device selection and audio mappings, opening or
recovering another show, Save As, bus/blend structure, transforms,
effect-chain reordering and resets, modulation, package selection and advanced
master-effect editing. Audio meters and response controls stay live, and so do
video-input switching and camera recording, which are performance controls.
**Save** (`Cmd/Ctrl+S`) and autosave keep working. The lock is enforced by the
application, not only by hiding controls. Press **EXIT SHOW MODE** to return
to preparation.
The lock is deliberately temporary and is not stored in a project.

Master freeze intentionally holds the exact final program frame. While it is
active, deck FX, deletion and source changes are accepted but cannot appear on
program output until freeze is released. A warning appears directly above the
selected deck editor whenever this hold is active.

The main workspace always renders the selected deck as the primary performance
editor with its deck controls and FX visible. Click a **DECK A–D** row label in
the clip grid—or any slot in that row—to change the selected editor. Setup and
diagnostics start collapsed, and the remaining three full deck editors are
available under **Other deck editors** when detailed side-by-side preparation
is needed.

FFmpeg and its development libraries must be installed. HAP uses the direct
GPU-compressed path; other supported movies and stills use FFmpeg.

## Load and trigger clips

1. Drag a MOV, MP4, MKV, AVI, WebM, MXF, PNG or JPEG file from the desktop
   onto the clip slot you want, for example deck C slot 2. That slot and deck
   become selected and the clip loads there. Dropping several files together
   fills the following slots of the same deck. Dropping onto a deck strip loads
   that deck's selected slot; dropping anywhere else uses the selected deck and
   slot, as before.
2. Wait for the slot to show its thumbnail and filled-circle first-frame
   readiness marker.
3. Click the slot to launch it.

To reorganize a bank, drag any populated or missing-media slot onto another
slot. An empty destination receives the clip; an occupied destination swaps
the two clips so media is never overwritten. Playback settings and previews
follow their clips. Slots with an active import or restore cannot move until
that background operation finishes.

The selected slot is shown directly below the grid with a **Delete selected
clip** button. `Delete` or `Backspace` performs the same action when a text
field is not consuming the key. Deletion clears pending slot work, queued
launches and cached previews through the same journaled path. Deleting the
currently playing slot also stops its decoder, clears its uploaded GPU texture
and empties that deck's live signal. Show Mode blocks clip deletion.

To populate multiple slots, drag a folder onto the starting slot (or select
the starting slot and drop the folder anywhere else in the window). VIRTUAL recursively finds supported media, sorts paths
lexically, fills from the selected slot, wraps across decks and skips occupied
slots. At most the 32 available clip addresses are assigned. The status line
reports scanning, probe progress, truncation caused by available capacity and
completion.

Folder scanning accepts MOV, MP4, M4V, MKV, AVI, WebM, MXF, PNG, JPG and JPEG.
It is bounded to 16 directory levels and 4,096 entries per directory. Files
that fail probing remain visible in their assigned slot with an error while
the rest continue importing.

Scene buttons and number keys `1`–`8` launch the same slot across all four
decks. Choose Immediate, Next beat or Next bar before triggering.

A filled circle means the bounded first-frame launch preview is ready. An open
circle means metadata is ready but the preview worker is still decoding. The
header shows the total ready count out of 32. On a ready launch, this preview
appears immediately and is replaced by the full-resolution decoder output.

Each active deck exposes level, A/B bus assignment, play/pause, restart,
freeze, loop/one-shot, speed and seek controls. Camera decks expose freeze but
disable file-only transport controls.

Expand **Selected clip playback** below the clip grid to configure the selected
slot:

- **Restart at In** always launches from the trim start.
- **Resume last position** remembers where that slot was when another source
  replaced it; reaching the end causes the next resume to start at In.
- **In** and optional **Out** are source-time seconds.
- **BPM-relative duration** limits the range to a number of beats from In. The
  effective end uses whichever comes first: Out, media end or beat duration.

The deck playhead, Restart, Loop and One shot controls all respect this
effective range. Changing BPM immediately changes a beat-relative boundary.

Conventional-codec slots show their indexed keyframe count in the deck
metadata and clip tooltip. A `capped` marker means the clip reached the
65,536-entry safety limit; seeking still works, but targets after the indexed
region may require a longer forward decode from the last indexed anchor. HAP
clips use their direct compressed path and do not report a conventional
keyframe index.

The performance line includes **RGBA pool** diagnostics:

- **alloc** counts new pixel buffers or capacity growth.
- **reuse** counts frames served by returned storage.
- **live** is the number of leases still held by decode/scheduling/render.
- **discard** counts non-blocking returns dropped because the bounded pool was
  full or gone.
- **MiB** is cumulative allocated pixel capacity, not current resident memory.

During stable-resolution playback, `alloc` should flatten while `reuse`
continues increasing. Growth after a resolution switch is expected; continuous
growth at a fixed resolution should be treated as a soak-test failure.

## Decoder failure rehearsal and soak

The normal workspace tests include an injected mid-stream decoder failure,
recovery on a new generation, 100,000 frame-buffer reuse cycles, 10,000
generation changes and 64 FFmpeg reopen cycles. Before a release candidate,
run the extended 10,000-reopen decoder soak:

```sh
cargo test -p virtual-media --test hap_mov_demux \
  extended_decoder_reopen_soak -- --ignored --exact
```

The test fails if fixed-resolution RGBA allocation grows beyond the decoder's
bounded working set, a generation is mislabeled, a reopen fails or a frame
lease remains live after the source ends. This complements, but does not
replace, a show-machine soak with the actual media, capture devices and output
displays.

## Connect a camera or capture card

1. Select the destination deck and an empty clip slot.
2. Choose an AVFoundation device in the **Deck input** strip below the clip
   grid.
3. Set the requested width, height and frame rate.
4. Click **Video**. The same controls remain available in Show Mode.
5. Click **Record clip**, then **Stop**. VIRTUAL finalizes the movie in the
   workspace `recordings` directory and installs it in the selected slot after
   probing and thumbnail generation complete.

Use **Refresh** after attaching hardware. A manual AVFoundation device ID such
as `0` can be entered when discovery does not return a label. macOS may require
camera permission for VIRTUAL or Terminal. HDMI capture cards that appear as
AVFoundation video devices use the same path.

Live capture and recording use bounded queues. If rendering or storage stalls,
stale frames are dropped to keep latency from growing; the Deck input strip
reports recording drops. Recordings use uncompressed RGBA MOV for predictable,
encoder-free capture, so allow roughly 6.6 GB per minute at 720p30 or 14.9 GB
per minute at 1080p30. Short capture loops are the intended first workflow;
compressed recording is a planned upgrade.

## Effects

VIRTUAL currently has two distinct effect paths: three built-in groups that
run independently on every deck inside the fused compositor, and
manifest-driven packages that run only in the two master slots. A planned
`deck-v1` package stage will sit between those built-in groups and layer
blending; it is not operator-selectable yet. See
[Shader system](SHADER_SYSTEM.md) for that delivery plan.

Open **GPU effects** on a deck. Available controls include:

- Hue, contrast, saturation, black level, white level and gamma
- Bit reduction and black-light inversion
- Mirror, neon glow, fractal fold, jitter and find edges
- Three more fold algorithms beside fractal fold, each with its own amount
  that can be stacked, MIDI-learned and LFO/audio-modulated:
  - **Spiral fold** twists the kaleidoscope seams with distance from the
    centre and drifts slowly, so wedges spiral inward.
  - **Kali fold** is a recursive Kaliset inversion fold (`|p| / p·p − c`);
    the amount deepens the recursion smoothly, from soft warps to dense
    fractal detail.
  - **Koch fold** mirrors the image into a snowflake sixth and recursively
    reflects it along Koch-curve edges, tiling it into crystalline cells.
- Pixelate, luma key, bloom threshold/radius and chromatic bloom spread

The chain has three rows: **Geometry**, **Color + levels**, and **Stylize +
key**. Use the arrow buttons to reorder them. Every row has an independent
**Bypass** and **wet** control; zero wet returns that stage to its dry input
without changing its parameter knobs. Geometry remains the bounded UV prepass;
Color and Stylize follow their relative displayed order. **Load preset** offers
Neutral, Neon night, Blacklight, Glitch and Halation. **Reset chain** or
**Reset effects** restores neutral parameters, full wet, no bypass and the
legacy-compatible Geometry → Color → Stylize order.

Effects run on each source before deck composition. Slot order, bypass and wet
mix are saved in the project. Existing projects that predate effect slots open
with the legacy-compatible default order.

### Master effects and blur

Expand **Master effects** below the crossfader and master controls. Two
reorderable slots can be Empty, Separable blur, Feedback / trails or Custom
package. Blur exposes a 0–32 pixel radius. Feedback exposes 0–0.99 persistence;
larger values retain more of the previous final frame. Every kind uses the
common bypass and wet controls. The arrow buttons change master evaluation
order, and **Reset master effects** returns both slots to Empty.

With both slots empty or bypassed, composition renders directly to program
output. Enabling blur or feedback activates fixed ping-pong/history targets
allocated at the chosen composition resolution; no effect texture is created
during a frame. The program target also reserves one custom history texture per
master slot. UHD uses about 189.8 MiB of additional bounded texture storage
versus the direct path, so certify the target GPU at show resolution.

Feedback history resets on a source launch/change, active source removal,
project load, composition resize, blackout, or after feedback is disabled.
The first frame after reset is clean and seeds new history. Master freeze holds
the exact final frame and pauses history evolution; blackout still takes
priority and clears the future history state.

The **Effect package** field points to a versioned JSON manifest. The bundled
processor is resolved from trusted development, executable-adjacent or macOS
bundle resources rather than from the process launch directory. Choose
**Watch** after changing the path; the app checks the manifest and referenced
WGSL every 500 ms.
**Reload now** requests an immediate compile even when the files appear
unchanged. Successful reloads show the package name and fingerprint. Rejected
schema, WGSL or GPU pipeline changes are shown in amber and the last working
pipeline remains on program output.

Package shader paths must be relative to the manifest and cannot traverse out
of their directory. A replacement `master_processor` package must retain the
documented master-v1 bindings and declared vertex/fragment entry points.

Packages targeting the master runtime in an immediate subdirectory of any
effect resource root appear when a master slot is set to **Custom package**.
That includes manifest-v1 role `master_effect` and manifest-v2 role `effect`
with target `master` and ABI `master-v1`. Bundled resources are found from the
development workspace, beside a release binary, or in a macOS bundle without
depending on its launch directory. An existing `effects` directory in the
active show workspace is also scanned. User packages can live in
`~/Library/Application Support/VIRTUAL/effects`; additional roots come from
the platform-separated `VIRTUAL_EFFECT_PATH` environment variable.
Select a package and its manifest controls are created automatically.
**Refresh registry** performs one synchronous rescan after adding or removing
a package, then hands registered replacements to the reload worker without
discarding the last working pipelines while they compile. Very large custom
package roots can therefore cause a brief control-side pause until the planned
asynchronous registry scan lands. Parameter
values and package IDs were introduced in project version 3 and remain part of
the current version-5 schema. If a saved package has never loaded, that slot
passes its input through unchanged. The package panel reports whether the
selected effect uses one or two bounded render passes.

Expand **Master modulation matrix** for three free-running or tempo-synced LFOs
and eight routes. A route can use a master LFO, RMS, bass, mid, high, transient,
beat phase or bar phase, then target any parameter in either active custom
slot. Amount is bipolar; negative values invert the source. Targets use stable
package/parameter identity, so reordering controls in a manifest does not
redirect saved routes.

Each generated custom parameter also has **MIDI learn** and **Clear** buttons.
Connect a controller, click Learn and move the desired hardware control.
Custom ranges outside 0–1 can be adjusted in the MIDI mapping table's output
range fields.

**Chromatic Split** is the bundled one-pass example. **Spectral Echo** is the
two-pass example: its first pass produces an intermediate in the fixed scratch
texture and its second pass combines that intermediate into the slot output.
**Temporal Melt** demonstrates the optional previous-slot-output history.
Its first frame after selection or reset is clean; subsequent frames sample the
saved slot output. The custom package panel identifies temporal packages.

The bundled algorithmic set also includes **Recursive 2D Lab** (mirror IFS,
Julia and Möbius-like image recursion), **Fractal Volume 3D** (box nebula,
kaleidoscopic tunnel and orbit-bulb fields), and **Hyper Recursion 4D+**
(tesseract, quaternion and Clifford-style 4D–6D projections). Choose Custom
package, select one of these names, then start from its three supplied looks or
shape the grouped function, transform, motion and finish controls directly.
These three packages are available in both master Custom slots and each deck's
**Algorithmic package** selector. Deck placement runs after that deck's
built-in effects and before its selected layer blend.

## Layer transforms

Open **Layer transform** on a deck to adjust:

- Horizontal and vertical position in normalized output coordinates
- Uniform scale from 0.05× through 4×
- Rotation from -360° through 360°
- Independent horizontal and vertical flips
- Left, right, top and bottom normalized crop
- **Fit** to preserve the full image with transparent bars
- **Fill** to preserve aspect while centrally cropping to cover the layer
- **Stretch** to map the cropped source directly to the layer

Pixels moved outside the layer bounds become transparent instead of smearing
the source edge. **Reset transform** restores centered, unscaled, unrotated
and uncropped Stretch geometry. Transform settings are stored per deck in the
project.

## Blend modes

Choose a blend mode beside each deck's Bus A/Bus B assignment:

The picker exposes 35 modes across Standard, Contrast, Component and VIRTUAL
families. Familiar examples include:

- Normal
- Add
- Screen
- Multiply
- Difference
- Lighten
- Darken
- Overlay

The mode controls how that deck combines with layers already accumulated
inside its assigned bus. Blending is calculated in linear light with
alpha-correct source-over coverage. The selected mode is stored in the project;
older projects load as Normal.

## Solo and bypass

Use **Solo** to isolate a deck without changing any other deck settings.
Multiple soloed decks remain active together, including decks assigned to
different buses. When any Solo is active, non-solo decks are excluded before
bus composition.

Use **Bypass** to remove a deck from composition while preserving its level,
bus, transform, blend mode and effects. Bypass takes precedence over Solo.
These controls are stored in the project; older projects load with every deck
active and unsoloed.

## LFOs and modulation matrix

Open **LFOs + Mod Matrix** on a deck.

Each deck has three LFO sources. An LFO can run in Hz or synchronize to the
internal beat clock at 1/16 to 8 beats per cycle, including triplet and dotted
divisions. Waveforms are sine, triangle, saw up, saw down, square, sample & hold
and smooth random. **Unipolar** keeps the output between 0 and 1, **Invert**
flips it, and **Offset** shifts the whole wave.

Enable **Direct** for a simple one-source/one-destination assignment. Disable
Direct to use the LFO only as a matrix source.

The matrix has eight routes per deck:

- Choose LFO 1–3, Audio RMS, bass, mid, high, transient, beat phase, bar
  phase or any of the eight spectrum bands as the source.
- Choose any continuous effect parameter as the destination.
- Set an amount from `-1.0` to `+1.0`.
- Negative amounts invert the modulation.
- Multiple routes can share a source or destination and are summed safely.

## Audio-reactive modulation

Open the **AUDIO SPECTRUM** strip below the clip grid. Choose an input (the
built-in microphone or any audio interface) and click **Connect**. On macOS,
grant microphone/audio-input permission if prompted. For a multi-channel
interface, pick one channel or **All channels (mono mix)**; changing the
channel while connected reconnects immediately. The strip's header shows a live
mini-spectrum even when collapsed.

### Waveform and spectrum view

Above the band bars, a fine spectrum curve runs from 20 Hz to 20 kHz on a log
scale with the eight bands shaded behind it and a slowly falling peak-hold
trace. Hover it to read the exact frequency, level and band; click a band's
region to start mapping that band. The readout above it names the loudest
frequency and its band, which is the quickest way to find where a kick, bass
line or hi-hat sits. Below, the waveform shows the last four seconds of input
(red columns are clipping) beside an oscilloscope of the latest ~21 ms.
**Freeze** holds both views for inspection; **Reset peaks** clears the
peak-hold trace.

### 8-band spectrum EQ

The spectrum splits the input into eight bands: Sub 20–60 Hz, Bass 60–150 Hz,
Low mid 150–400 Hz, Mid 400 Hz–1 kHz, Upper mid 1–2.5 kHz, Presence 2.5–5 kHz,
Brilliance 5–10 kHz and Air 10–20 kHz. Each band has a live bar with a falling
peak marker and a gain slider from −24 to +24 dB (double-click resets it).
**Flat EQ** clears the gains; **Music tilt** lifts the quieter upper bands so
every band moves on typical music. **dB** scale maps the chosen range below
full scale onto 0–1 and keeps quiet bands visible; **Linear** follows raw
amplitude with the gain and noise-floor controls.

### Mapping bands to controls

Press **Map** under a band (or under Level or Transient), then click any
highlighted control: map mode switches on while you choose and switches back
off afterwards. The mapping table lists every binding with:

- **Mode**: *Continuous* follows the band across the output range; *Trigger*
  fires once each time the band crosses the threshold (clip and scene launches,
  restart, tap tempo); *Gate* holds the control on while the band is above the
  threshold (blackout, freeze, play). Launch-style controls default to Trigger
  or Gate.
- **Threshold** for Trigger and Gate, drawn as a marker on the band's bar.
- **Band in**: the part of the band's 0–1 range that spans the whole output.
- **Output**: the value range sent to the control.
- **Inv** to invert, a live meter, and ✕ to remove.

The control picker also lists the parameters of the algorithms loaded on each
deck and master slot. Continuous mappings drive their control directly and are
not written to the show journal; triggers and gates are journaled like MIDI.
Mappings, band gains, the scale and the input device and channel are saved
with the project, and the input reconnects on load when it is present.

Analysis controls, under **Input response**, are:

- **Gain**: scales all normalized signals.
- **Noise floor**: suppresses low-level room/device noise.
- **Attack** and **release**: smooth RMS and band envelopes.
- **Transient**: scales positive RMS onsets.
- **Adaptive normalization**: slowly adjusts analysis gain toward the selected
  target RMS; adaptation speed controls how quickly it follows level changes.

The native callback only downmixes into fixed-size chunks and attempts a
non-blocking bounded-queue write. FFT and smoothing run on a worker. If the
queue is full, the chunk is dropped and the overrun counter increases. A
callback error resolves all audio matrix sources to zero. If samples stop
arriving without an error, the analysis worker clears the last reading after
250 ms and resumes when samples return. Audio meters remain visible in the
toolbar during Show Mode. Select capture-card audio separately from its video;
video-file soundtracks are not analyzed by the video decoder.

Beat phase ramps from 0 to 1 every beat. Bar phase ramps from 0 to 1 across
four beats. Both follow the internal tempo clock and retain phase when BPM
changes.

## Tempo

The always-visible toolbar provides BPM and **Tap tempo**, including Show Mode.

Enter BPM directly or use:

- **Tap**: establishes tempo after two taps and averages recent taps.
- **½**: halves the current BPM.
- **×2**: doubles the current BPM.

Tempo changes preserve the current musical position. The toolbar displays beat
position, beat phase and four-beat bar phase.

Tempo can also come from an external MIDI beat clock, and VIRTUAL can clock
other gear itself. Both live in **Setup → MIDI control → Clock sync**; while an
external clock is locked, the BPM field, **Tap**, **½** and **×2** are disabled
because the incoming clock owns the tempo. See
[MIDI beat-clock sync](MIDI_SYNC.md).

## Mixing and emergency controls

Assign decks to Bus A or Bus B, then use the crossfader. Linear and equal-power
curves are available.

The **LAYERS** row under the crossfader sets the stacking order, bottom to top.
Click a deck to bring it to the top, or use ◀ / ▶ to move it one layer. The
order applies within each bus: the crossfader still blends Bus A against Bus B.
To keep one source on top during crossfades or modulated blends, pick it in
**Pin … over mix**. A pinned deck is drawn over the crossfaded result, so the
crossfader never fades it out; its own level, blend mode, solo and bypass still
apply. **Reset** restores A–D stacking and unpins. Both settings are saved with
the project.

A compact copy of the row (deck chips, PIN and Reset) sits in the master
toolbar next to BLACKOUT and Freeze master. Every layer control is MIDI
learnable: arm **MIDI Map** and click a deck chip (to top), ◀ / ▶ (down / up),
PIN or Reset. Pads learn as momentary for the reorder triggers and as toggles
for PIN. The toolbar's BLACKOUT, Freeze master and channel mute buttons, and the
deck strip's Bypass, are learnable too.

### Mapping any button

Almost every button, toggle and choice in the app can be mapped to a pad or
button on a controller: arm **MIDI Map**, click the on-screen button (it is
outlined like the sliders), then press the controller button. Right-click clears
the mapping. Pads learn as momentary presses, and a press does exactly what a
mouse click would: it toggles a checkbox, picks a choice (Bus A/B, Loop or Play
once, blend mode, quantize, resolution, …) or runs an action (Eject, presets,
New seed, Reset chain, Save, Scan journals, …).

- A mapped press only acts on a button that is on screen. Buttons in a
  collapsed section, a closed window or hidden by Show Mode ignore the press;
  the press is not saved for later. Effect presets and blend modes are the
  exception: they still respond while their menu is closed.
- Disabled buttons ignore presses, as they ignore clicks.
- Not mappable: file-picker buttons (Open…, Save As…, Relink…), the clip
  right-click menu, dropdown device lists, the custom-colour editor, and the
  MIDI Manager and learn controls themselves.
- Mappings save with the project and survive layout and theme changes, because
  each button has a fixed internal key. In the MIDI Manager a button mapping is
  listed by name once that button has been drawn this session.

Stage-safety shortcuts:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `B` | Toggle master blackout |
| `Space` | Toggle master freeze |
| `O` | Toggle the clean program output |
| `Left` / `Right` | Move the crossfader |
| `Home` | Center the crossfader |
| `1`–`8` | Launch a scene |
| `Cmd/Ctrl+S` | Save the current project (asks for a location when none is set) |
| `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+S` | Save As… (not in Show Mode) |
| `Cmd/Ctrl+O` | Open a show (not in Show Mode) |

Single-key shortcuts only act when no modifier is held and no text field
has keyboard focus, so typing a project path or take name never triggers
blackout, freeze, output or scene launches. `Cmd/Ctrl+S` and `Cmd/Ctrl+O`
work everywhere.

## Program output

VIRTUAL renders the mixer once into an offscreen program texture. The operator
window previews that texture beneath the controls, while the separate
**VIRTUAL · PROGRAM** window presents it without UI.

Use the top toolbar to:

- Show or hide **Program output**
- Toggle borderless **Fullscreen**
- Select a connected display and refresh the list after reconnecting hardware
- Select 720p, 1080p or UHD composition resolution
- Enter a custom width and height, then click **Apply**
- Show a color-bar/grid **Test card** or magenta **Identify** frame

The selected display receives the window and borderless fullscreen target.
Press `Escape` to leave fullscreen. Display preference, output visibility,
fullscreen state, composition resolution and calibration-overlay state are
stored in the project. Press `O` for an immediate output-window disable/enable
action.

Expand **Output health** to verify the current display, swapchain size,
composition size and FIFO presentation mode. The counters distinguish
presented and skipped frames, automatic reconfigurations, successful
recoveries, timeouts, occlusion, validation errors and display-topology
changes. Connected displays are polled every two seconds, so reconnecting an
adapter or projector updates the target list without restarting the app.

## MIDI controllers

Open **MIDI** in the top bar for the multi-controller manager. Connect any
number of detected devices; each remains independently identified, metered and
mapped. Press **MIDI MAP MODE**, click a highlighted control in the operator
surface, then move a knob, encoder, fader or button. Right-click a highlighted
control to clear its assignments. The top-bar **MAP** indicator exits mapping
mode from anywhere in the interface.

The compact **MIDI control** panel remains available in Setup for target-list
learning and detailed mapping edits. **Cancel learn** exits without changing a
mapping; **Clear target** removes every mapping for the selected target.
Individual rows can also be removed.

Each row supports:

- **Absolute** for normal knobs/faders and pitch bend.
- **Momentary** for press/release behavior.
- **Toggle** for one-button latching.
- **Relative offset** for encoders centered on value 64.
- **Relative 2's comp** for encoders sending `1`/`127` increments.
- Editable output minimum/maximum, inversion and pickup/soft takeover.

Learning picks sensible defaults. Pads and keys become **Momentary** on clip,
scene, restart, select and tap targets, so a soft velocity-sensitive hit still
fires, and **Toggle** on blackout, freeze, play and enable switches. Knobs get
the target's natural range, for example 0.5–2× for deck speed. Toggle always
flips the control's current state, even after it was changed on screen. With
pickup enabled, a control re-arms whenever its value moves from another source,
and catches up as soon as the hardware reaches or sweeps past it. A **shared**
tag marks a physical control that drives more than one target.

Mappings cover crossfader/master controls, all four deck transports and
levels, clip and scene launches, effects, LFO parameters and modulation-matrix
routes. Blackout and master freeze act immediately; clip and scene launches
still follow the current quantization setting.

**Clock sync** in the same panel selects the tempo master, pins which device
may clock the show, and connects a destination for outgoing clock. Sync
messages never take part in learn, so one device can both clock the show and
drive mapped controls.

The activity line shows received packets, queue drops and parse errors per
device. If a requested controller disappears, VIRTUAL keeps its mappings,
shows it as waiting in MIDI Manager and attempts to reconnect every two
seconds. Use **Disconnect** or **Forget** to stop that automatic reconnect
intent. The requested controller set is stored with the project; controllers
from a previous project do not remain live after another rig is opened.

## Projects and recovery

The project toolbar can open and save `.virtual` files by path or through the
native **Open…** and **Save As…** dialogs. Opening another show is blocked in
Show Mode. Clips inside the project's folder are stored relative to it, so
copy the whole show folder to move a show between drives or machines. Version-six projects store all 32
clip paths, per-slot trim/launch/beat settings, deck state, camera reconnect
settings, mixer values, transport, effects, per-deck algorithmic packages,
LFOs, modulation routes, tempo,
output settings, theme/layout choices, MIDI mapping data and requested MIDI
devices.
Version-one projects are upgraded when loaded.

Opening another show while the current one has unsaved changes asks
**Save**, **Discard** or **Cancel**. Save writes the current show to its own
file, asking for a location if it is untitled. The new show opens only after
that save succeeds and nothing changed while it was saving; otherwise the
current show stays open and the status explains why.

VIRTUAL writes a recovery autosave after changes and on close. Use **Recover
autosave** when the recovery copy is newer. A successful save retires the
show's autosave, so the offer only appears when unsaved work exists. A
recovered show saves to a new `<show> (recovered).virtual` beside the original
and never overwrites an existing file. Missing files remain represented in
their original slots. Select a missing slot and press **Browse and relink…**,
or right-click any path-bearing slot and choose **Relink media…**. The native
picker starts beside the previous file when that directory still exists.
Relinking preserves the slot's In/Out trim, launch mode and beat duration. If
the slot is live, a successful relink launches the replacement automatically.

## Pre-show checklist

1. Run a release build on the actual show machine.
2. Confirm camera, audio and MIDI permissions.
3. Trigger every required clip and inspect media-health warnings.
4. Verify HAP clips report the direct path.
5. Exercise blackout and freeze.
6. Watch FPS and dropped/repeated/late counters.
7. Exercise every MIDI mapping, including pickup after moving a saved
   parameter away from the hardware position.
8. Disconnect and reconnect the controller and confirm activity resumes.
9. Save the project, close it, and verify restoration.
10. Select the stage display and verify the test card through the full signal path.
11. Disable sleep, automatic updates and unnecessary background applications.
