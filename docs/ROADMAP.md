# Prioritized implementation plan

This plan was revised after reviewing the application against the original MVP
notes. The ordering is based on stage usability and dependency risk, not on
which feature is most visually interesting.

## September 2026 reliability follow-up

Implemented: background project saves/autosaves, camera read cancellation and
cooperative open/read deadlines, capture-timed camera recording with dropped-tail
preservation, raw-recording storage estimates and a v6 golden project fixture.

Next: certify these changes with the physical failure matrix, produce the
self-contained macOS bundle, and add frame-time/decode/upload diagnostics.
Camera recording still uses uncompressed RGBA; compressed recording and disk
capacity feedback remain open. Clip automation has a tested core evaluator but
still needs application wiring, persistence and an editor. The existing scene
controls already launch a slot across all four decks; the next clip work is to
add automation-only cells for live/generator decks, tempo-locked 1–64 bar loops,
Draw/Select editing and reverse playback. Program-output recording is separate
from the implemented camera-to-clip recorder. See [feature designs](FEATURE_DESIGNS.md).

## Current execution sequence

The August 2026 upgrade audit is being applied in this order:

1. **Certify the baseline.** Keep strict Clippy, workspace tests, v1-v6 golden
   projects and the release build green. Run the separate physical-hardware
   matrix on the target show machine and record the binary hash.
2. **Reduce app and UI coupling.** Route UI intent through one action boundary,
   move output lifecycle ownership out of `State`, then split the remaining
   toolbar, setup and diagnostics panels. The action boundary, focused output
   lifecycle owner, and remaining UI panel splits are implemented.
3. **Improve live diagnostics.** Add frame-time history, decoder/upload timing,
   dropped-frame visibility and actionable output-recovery detail.
4. **Modernize the shader system.** Establish the target-aware package
   contract, selectively unfuse deck branches, then ship one bounded package
   slot per deck before pursuing HDR, compute or import compatibility.
5. **Finish distribution readiness.** Add bundle metadata and permissions,
   settle FFmpeg distribution obligations, then sign and notarize the macOS
   build.
6. **Deepen performance control.** Add MIDI feedback, clock/sync and controller
   templates after the current input path passes hardware soak testing.
7. **Expand graph/session authoring.** Continue from the compatibility graph to
   general execution and live editing only after the show-critical seams above
   are stable.
8. **Add stage integrations last.** Treat NDI/Syphon/Spout, SMPTE/Link and
   capture/recording as post-certification work so they do not destabilize the
   core release path.

## Phase 0: establish a reliable baseline

The completed feature slices have been preserved as intentional checkpoints.
Before another large subsystem lands:

1. Preserve validated feature slices as intentional checkpoints. (implemented)
2. Record release-mode performance for two and four simultaneous 1080p60 HAP
   sources using the matrix in `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`.
3. Maintain a repeatable local fixture set for HAP, conventional video, still
   and live-camera playback. The checklist is implemented; redistributable
   fixture media still needs to be produced.
4. Split application orchestration into focused output, media-session and
   action modules; keep `main.rs` as event-loop wiring. (in progress: UI action
   dispatch and output lifecycle ownership extracted; media-session ownership
   remains)
5. Complete the operator UI split. Clip grid, deck, master FX, MIDI, theme,
   toolbar, setup and diagnostics modules are implemented. (implemented)
6. Maintain checked-in golden v1-v6 projects and migration/save-reload tests
   before introducing further schema changes. (implemented)

Acceptance criteria:

- Full tests and strict Clippy remain clean.
- A release-build smoke test can be repeated from documented commands.
- No behavior changes are introduced by the module split.
- Every release candidate has a dated show-machine checklist and binary hash.

## Phase 1: dedicated program output

Status: implementation complete; hardware validation remains. The offscreen
program texture, clean second window, display targeting, enable/disable
control, borderless fullscreen, preset and custom resolutions, calibration
overlays and project persistence are implemented. Presentation preserves
composition aspect ratio with automatic letterbox or pillarbox bars. Surface
acquisition and display-topology health are observable in the operator UI.

Delivered:

1. Shared GPU instance/device/queue with independent surfaces
2. Single offscreen composition render
3. Operator preview and clean program presentation passes
4. Windowed, hidden and borderless fullscreen output
5. 720p, 1080p and UHD composition presets
6. Version-two project persistence and v1 migration
7. Aspect-preserving presentation
8. Connected-display enumeration, selection and refresh
9. Custom 320×180 through 7680×4320 composition sizing
10. GPU-rendered test card and output-identification overlay
11. Persistence for the selected display and calibration state
12. Exact surface acquisition status, recovery counters and operator diagnostics
13. Two-second display-topology polling and reconnect fallback

Remaining:

1. Harden display identity across topology changes with identical display models.
2. Complete show-machine display reconnect and long-run soak testing.

Acceptance criteria:

- The output window never contains operator UI.
- Output can move between displays and recover from surface loss.
- Closing or disabling output does not stop decoding or the operator window.
- Blackout, freeze and disable-output execute on the next rendered frame.
- Output resolution is independent from operator-window size. (implemented)
- Two 1080p60 HAP sources plus active effects sustain the target display rate
  on the show machine.

## Phase 2: correct layer composition

Status: implementation complete. Decks are composited into independent A and B
images in fixed order within each bus, then the completed bus images are
crossfaded. The layer-control model includes transforms, source modes, crop,
blend modes, Solo and Bypass.

Implementation sequence:

1. Define explicit Bus A and Bus B intermediate composites. (implemented)
2. Crossfade the two completed bus images instead of multiplying each deck's
   level by a bus gain. (implemented)
3. Add position, scale, rotation and horizontal/vertical flip. (implemented)
4. Add crop plus fit, fill and stretch source modes. (implemented)
5. Add linear-light Normal, Add, Screen, Multiply, Difference, Lighten, Darken
   and Overlay blend modes. (implemented and GPU tested)
6. Add per-deck solo and bypass. (implemented and GPU tested)
7. Persist and validate every composition field. (implemented)

Acceptance criteria:

- Bus results do not depend on the other bus's deck order. (GPU tested)
- Transform and crop behavior is consistent for HAP, RGBA, still and camera
  sources. (transform path implemented and GPU tested)
- Every blend mode has GPU readback coverage using known input colors.
- Neutral defaults render identically to the current mixer.
  (preserved through project compatibility defaults)

## Phase 3: audio-reactive modulation

Status: implementation complete; hardware validation remains. Native input
capture, bounded callback handoff, worker-thread RMS/FFT analysis, adaptive
normalization, live diagnostics, five audio sources and beat/bar phase sources
are implemented.

Implementation sequence:

1. Add input-device enumeration and a bounded audio callback adapter in
   `virtual-io`. (implemented)
2. Copy callback samples into a fixed-capacity queue; never perform FFT or UI
   work inside the callback. (implemented)
3. Publish smoothed broadband RMS, bass, mid, high and transient signals from
   an analysis worker. (implemented)
4. Add gain, noise floor, attack, release and normalization. (implemented)
5. Generalize matrix source identifiers beyond LFO 1–3. (implemented)
6. Add audio sources, beat phase and bar phase to the routing UI. (implemented)
7. Persist device-independent analysis and routing settings. (implemented)
8. Display input device, sample rate, queue overrun and signal-health status.
   (implemented)

Acceptance criteria:

- The render thread reads a snapshot and never waits on audio work.
- Disconnecting an input device resolves sources safely to zero.
- Band separation, envelope timing and transient behavior have deterministic
  signal-fixture tests. (implemented, including normalization convergence)
- Audio queue growth is bounded and overruns are observable.

## Phase 4: physical performance control

Implemented. The device-neutral mapper is now connected to native hardware and
is operable without editing project JSON.

Implementation sequence:

1. Platform MIDI input and device enumeration. (implemented)
2. Learn/cancel/clear/remove UI around exposed controls. (implemented)
3. Note, CC, pitch bend, binary-offset and two's-complement encoders.
   (implemented)
4. Clip, scene, transport, mixer, effect, LFO, matrix and emergency targets.
   (implemented)
5. Pickup/soft-takeover, editable ranges and mapping activity. (implemented)
6. Controller reconnection and device-missing behavior. (implemented)

Acceptance criteria:

- MIDI callbacks use bounded `try_send` and cannot block rendering.
- Reconnecting a known controller restores its persisted mappings.
- Emergency blackout/freeze actions bypass launch quantization.
- Soft takeover prevents parameter jumps after project load.

Remaining MIDI work is output feedback, MIDI clock/sync, controller templates
and physical-device soak testing.

## Phase 5: clip readiness and media hardening

1. Preload and retain a bounded first-frame launch preview for every ready
   slot. (implemented at 640×360 maximum)
2. Add clip in/out points, restart/resume mode and BPM-relative duration.
   (implemented)
3. Build keyframe indexes for conventional-codec seeks. (implemented with a
   65,536-entry per-clip cap)
4. Add reusable CPU frame leases and steady-state allocation instrumentation.
   (implemented for conventional RGBA decode)
5. Add folder import. The fixed-size preload policy is implemented.
   (implemented with bounded recursive scanning and 32-slot assignment)
6. Add missing-media browsing and explicit relink. (implemented with a native
   per-slot picker, preserved playback settings and stale-result rejection)
7. Add decoder failure injection and long-running soak tests. (implemented
   with one-shot generation-scoped faults, accelerated allocation/generation/
   reopen coverage and an opt-in 10,000-reopen decoder soak)

Acceptance criteria:

- A preloaded launch is uploaded in the launch frame, before full decode
  produces its first scheduled frame. (implemented)
- Seeking and looping cannot present obsolete generations.
- The 32-slot first-frame cache is bounded to 29,491,200 bytes plus 160×90 UI
  thumbnails. (implemented)
- Missing files never prevent the rest of a project from opening.

## Phase 6: effect-chain architecture

1. Replace the monolithic fixed effect struct with three persisted deck-group
   controls and two reorderable master slots. (implemented; Geometry remains
   the UV prepass while Color and Stylize follow their relative order)
2. Add common bypass, dry/wet, reset and preset behavior. (implemented for
   deck slots with five factory presets)
3. Implement separable blur. (implemented in the master chain with fixed
   ping-pong targets)
4. Implement persistent feedback/trails textures. (implemented with bounded
   final-frame history and deterministic lifecycle resets)
5. Define effect manifests and validated parameter schemas. (implemented for
   the master shader package with version, identity, path, entry-point and
   control-range validation)
6. Compile changed WGSL away from presentation and retain the last valid
   pipeline after errors. (implemented with background polling/compilation,
   GPU error scopes and an atomic render-thread pipeline swap)
7. Register custom master effects, generate controls from their schemas and
   persist named values. (implemented with a 32-parameter `master-v1` ABI,
   neutral missing-package fallback and bundled Chromatic Split example)
8. Route custom controls through modulation and MIDI without positional
   identity. (implemented with stable package/parameter keys, three master
   LFOs, eight audio/beat/bar-capable routes and generated MIDI learn controls)
9. Add a bounded declarative multipass sequence. (implemented with one or two
   fragment passes, atomic pipeline-set reload, fixed scratch/ping reuse, pass
   index/count uniforms and bundled Spectral Echo reference; this is not yet a
   branching package graph)
10. Add a safely budgeted temporal package resource. (implemented as one fixed
    previous-slot-output history texture per master slot, with validity
    signaling, deterministic resets and bundled Temporal Melt reference)

### Shader-system upgrade program

The per-deck package decision is made. The canonical contracts, terminology,
memory gates and detailed acceptance criteria live in
[`SHADER_SYSTEM.md`](SHADER_SYSTEM.md).

Current foundation:

1. Atomic package-set compilation, generation-tagged result rejection and
   last-known-good retention are implemented. Slot-local rejected-generation
   and compile diagnostics remain.
2. Launch-independent development, executable-adjacent, macOS bundle,
   active-workspace, per-user and `VIRTUAL_EFFECT_PATH` discovery is
   implemented with deterministic duplicate handling.
3. Compact Show Mode master cards with identity, bypass and wet controls are
   implemented. A protected path to advanced parameters remains.
4. Stable package/parameter identity for persistence, modulation and MIDI is
   implemented. Richer typed parameter storage and migrations remain.
5. Real-GPU coverage renders all three algorithmic packages and proves
   last-known-good reload plus effect-before-blend layer behavior.

Delivery order:

1. **S0 — Contract/tooling foundation.** Target-aware catalog partitioning,
   asynchronous latest-wins registry discovery and `wgsl-analyzer` guidance
   are implemented. Retain ABI/layout conformance tests and compare one
   binding-generation approach against `encase` before choosing either.
2. **S1 — Per-deck precomposition seam.** Implemented: only package-bearing
   decks materialize after their built-ins, and the no-package path stays fused.
3. **S2 — One `deck-v1` slot per deck.** Core execution, UI, neutral fallback,
   project-v6 persistence, reload, stable modulation/MIDI/OSC identity,
   alpha/culling telemetry and per-deck GPU timestamps are implemented. Finish
   the four-deck show-machine gate.
4. **S3 — Versioned shared WGSL modules.** Prototype an allow-listed
   `virtual-std` namespace and fingerprint every transitive import.
5. **S4 — Typed N-pass fragment graph.** Declare pass edges, formats,
   resolutions, lifetimes and fallback through the graph compiler.
6. **S5 — Optional HDR intermediates.** Gate RGBA16Float by adapter support,
   memory tier, unclamped shader audit, tone mapping and deterministic SDR
   fallback.
7. **S6 — Compute/stateful effects.** Require typed storage resources, dispatch
   ceilings, reset semantics and capability checks.
8. **S7 — Offline importers.** Convert ISF first and a narrower ShaderToy
   subset later into validated native packages; Naga's GLSL parser alone is
   not a compatibility layer.

S2 is operator-selectable with visible invisible-deck culling counters and
fixed texture accounting. Per-pass GPU timing, package fingerprints in projects
and missing/changed-package preflight remain release gates.

Acceptance criteria:

- Invalid effect code cannot blank program output.
- Reordering and bypassing are generation-safe and allocation-bounded.
- Feedback history resets predictably on source replacement and project load.
- Per-deck dry/bypass is bit-exact, package alpha is preserved and a package
  executes before every layer blend mode.

## Phase 7: release hardening

1. Add GPU upload/render timing and per-deck decoder-health diagnostics.
2. Add test-card and failure-mode rehearsal documentation. (implemented in
   `OPERATOR_GUIDE.md` and `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`; execution remains per build)
3. Create macOS bundle metadata with camera and microphone usage strings.
4. Package, sign and notarize the application.
5. Decide FFmpeg dynamic/static distribution and verify license obligations.
6. Run show-machine soak, suspend/resume, display reconnect and storage-failure
   tests.

Open items carried from the September and October reviews. The code fixes
from those reviews have landed; these still need a person, a show machine or
real hardware:

- **Interactive checks:** shortcuts stay inert while typing, in both the
  operator and output windows; Save/Discard/Cancel with an unwritable
  destination; save-queue saturation; a visual pass at minimum window size
  and at several display scales.
- **Output health:** preflight still matches output health on the `"Healthy"`
  status string; replace it with a typed health state.
- **Hardware:** projector/fullscreen routing, display reconnect and adapters;
  camera and HDMI-card frame delivery and signal loss; audio capture
  permissions and real modulation; Link against Ableton Live on the show
  network, including phase alignment and latency.
- **Show machine:** the 30-minute fixture pass, four-deck performance
  benchmark, seek/source replacement, freeze/blackout and the full effects
  chain, recorded in `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` with the binary hash.
- **Distribution:** application icon, Developer ID signing and notarization,
  redistribution notices and source obligations, supported-OS policy, and a
  clean-Mac install; archive the exact release artifact and its hash.

## Phase 8: typed graph and deterministic session runtime

Status: the compatibility runtime, GPU lowering, command routing, recovery,
takes and bounded OSC transport are implemented. General graph execution and
live graph editing remain.

Delivered:

1. Device-neutral typed `ProjectGraph` and versioned node contracts.
2. Video, audio, control, event, async and external rate domains.
3. Port/type/required-input validation and explicit temporal cycle breaks.
4. Deterministic scheduling, rate-adapter insertion, resource lifetime reuse
   and hard GPU/texture budget checks.
5. Immutable `RenderPlan` with a compiled 11-node four-deck compatibility
   macro.
6. Shadow graph preparation that cannot mutate the active or last-known-good
   plan on failure.
7. Frame, beat, bar, exact-frame and timecode transaction scheduling.
8. Serializable `ShowCommand`, session state, checkpoints, replay, branches
   and named takes.
9. Runtime recording for graph activation, clip/scene launches, tempo changes
   and output enable changes.
10. Renderer lowering that validates the compatibility topology and turns the
    11 logical nodes into authoritative fused-composite, master-effect and
    program-output stages.
11. Graph-gated composition resizing and rollback to the previous plan when a
    candidate cannot be safely lowered.
12. A bounded background JSONL session journal with versioned headers,
    non-blocking render-thread enqueue, periodic fsync, atomic checkpoint
    replacement, torn-tail recovery and visible health counters.
13. An origin-aware application command gateway for every device-neutral MIDI
    target, keyboard emergency/mixer/scene control, semantic clip/transport/
    output commands and 208 built-in plus dynamic custom-effect UI values.
14. Record-before-apply structural snapshots for deck transforms, crop/source
    and blend modes, bus/solo/bypass, effect slots, LFO and modulation routing,
    master effects/modulation, plus accepted movie/folder/relink assignments.
15. An operator session-recovery catalog that excludes the active journal,
    validates checkpoint-plus-tail state, restores concrete controls and
    structures, and rotates to a fresh baseline journal.
16. Project schema v4 with stable project/take identities, bounded take
    metadata, linked journal headers, legacy compatibility and project-aware
    recovery filtering.
17. Project schema v5 with persisted typed graph and deterministic seed maps,
    compile-before-accept restoration, operator named takes and named recovery
    branches.
18. Full-history journal replay with checkpoint-aware timeline scrubbing plus
    safe project take metadata rename/removal that never deletes journal files.
19. First-class labeled timeline markers plus non-destructive take export and
    archive copies. Every copy receives a unique directory and retains both
    the journal and its atomic checkpoint when present.
20. Bounded OSC 1.0 UDP input with message/bundle decoding, visible malformed
    and overflow telemetry, and origin-aware command-gateway routes covering
    mixer, deck, clip, scene, tempo and output control.
21. Bounded asynchronous OSC state feedback with an initial control snapshot,
    plus NTP bundle-timetag conversion into a 1,024-event monotonic scheduler
    with a defensive 24-hour horizon and visible scheduling drops.

Next:

1. Add marker editing plus portable project/media manifests to exported takes.
2. Expand OSC effect/modulation routes and add route discovery.
3. Add shadow edit, preview, readiness and quantized commit UI.
4. Insert inferred color/resolution conversions and expose compiler
   diagnostics.
5. Add delay/rate-adapter executors and independent node passes where fusion
   is not valid.

Acceptance criteria:

- The current four-deck show renders entirely from the compiled plan without
  visual or performance regression. (implemented through bounded pass fusion)
- An invalid shadow graph cannot change program output.
- A recorded take restores the same state and deterministic seeds at any
  checkpoint.
- Every live mutation has a sequence number, origin and execution time.

## Deferred beyond the focused release

Single-quad projection warping and optional NDI sending are implemented.
Physical projector and network-receiver certification remain open. Multiple
simultaneous program outputs, edge blending, ISF import, Syphon/Spout, DMX,
Art-Net, the visual score, spatial engine and redundant render cluster remain
beyond the current graph-foundation slice.
Ableton Link, MIDI clock and recursive-geometry generator sources are
implemented. OSC transport is implemented; effect/modulation route expansion
and discovery remain in Phase 8.

## Phase 9: stage integration

Start only after the Phase 7 release gate is repeatable.

1. Ableton Link tempo/phase integration is implemented with GPL-2.0-or-later
   licensing. Finish network/hardware certification, opt-in transport sync and
   an SDK-free build feature; see [Link](ABLETON_LINK.md).
2. MIDI clock in and out with Song Position Pointer is implemented; see
   [MIDI sync](MIDI_SYNC.md).
3. Expand OSC effect/modulation routes and publish route discovery metadata.
4. Certify the optional NDI sender with real receivers, network interruption,
   runtime discovery and supported platform builds; the runtime is not bundled.
5. Prototype native Syphon/Spout texture sharing separately per platform.
6. Rehearse persisted corner-pin mapping, source crop and masks on physical
   projectors before pursuing edge blending or multiple program outputs.

Also not yet implemented:

- Automatic BPM detection. Tap tempo, MIDI clock and Link are available.
- Link transport (start/stop) sync.
- Decoding audio embedded in video files or capture streams for analysis.
  Capture cards' separate audio inputs can already be selected.

## Idea backlog

Unscheduled ideas worth keeping. None of these is committed work.

- **Network stream input.** SRT, RTSP and RTMP through the existing FFmpeg
  path, treated as a live, non-seekable source like a camera. Add a
  stream-URL field beside the video-input controls, use low-latency demuxer
  options, and show the host address to enter in a phone streaming app.
- **Generator control routing.** MIDI learn, OSC and LFO routes for
  generator parameters. Today only the deck's own effects, transforms and
  LFOs apply on top of a generator. See [Generators](GENERATORS.md).
- **Effect packages:**
  - *Slit-scan.* Temporal strips by position or luminance, using the
    history texture.
  - *Datamosh.* Smear the previous frame along a brightness-gradient
    pseudo-flow, with macroblock quantisation and a hold for drops.
  - *SDF crystal lattice.* Raymarched icosahedron, cubic or Menger lattice
    textured and refracted by the live frame.
  - *Reaction-diffusion.* Gray–Scott growth seeded by the video, in two
    passes using the history texture.

Dependency policy:

- Keep `wgpu` 29 with `egui-wgpu` 0.35. Upgrade `wgpu`, `naga` and the egui
  renderer compatibility line together.
- Evaluate `cpal` and `midir` upgrades independently with audio/MIDI hardware
  reconnect tests; do not combine them with a render-stack migration.
- External SDK and copyleft license decisions are release gates, not implicit
  implementation details.
